# :earth_americas: Population Choropleth

**Assign colors to counties on a US map, group counties by color, and calculate the populations of each color group.**

The app is built on Vue.js (v3) with Vuex for state management. D3.js is used to generate the interactive map, and the Census API is queried for population data.
